- Installed akamai/akamai v9.0.1 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID A26ECDD8F0BCBA73)
Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.
